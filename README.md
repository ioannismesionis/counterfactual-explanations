# 🤖 Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning Models

This repository contains an implementation of counterfactual explanations for machine learning models. Counterfactual explanations help understand how a model's predictions would change if the input features were different, providing actionable insights for model interpretability.

## 🎯 Overview

Counterfactual explanations are a powerful tool for understanding machine learning models by answering questions like "What changes would be needed to get a different prediction?" This implementation uses various techniques and libraries to generate and analyze counterfactual explanations.

## ✨ Features

- Implementation of counterfactual explanations using DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations)
- Support for various ML models (LightGBM, etc.)
- Visualization of counterfactual explanations
- Feature importance analysis using SHAP values
- Comprehensive notebook with examples and explanations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### 🔄 Counterfactual Generation
The project uses DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations) to generate counterfactual examples. The process involves:

1. **Model Training**:
   - Using LightGBM for the base model
   - Feature engineering and preprocessing
   - Model validation and performance metrics

2. **Counterfactual Generation**:
   - Setting up DiCE with the trained model
   - Defining feature constraints and ranges
   - Generating diverse counterfactual explanations

3. **Explanation Analysis**:
   - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance
   - Visualization of counterfactual differences
   - Actionable insights generation

### 🧩 Key Components

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Handling categorical variables
   - Missing value imputation

2. **Model Pipeline**:
   - LightGBM model configuration
   - Cross-validation setup
   - Model performance evaluation

3. **Counterfactual Analysis**:
   - Proximity metrics
   - Diversity measures
   - Feasibility constraints
